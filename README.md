### How to run it

First thing you have to install the necessary repositories by pip installing the required modules (requirements.txt)

Secondly the main.py is a notebook that runs all the necessary steps from getting the data to running all the models.
In the eda.ipynb you can find all the code that is necessary to produce most of the exploratory plots

I have also added some vscode settings in case you use vscode and want to debug the code
